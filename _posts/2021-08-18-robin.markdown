I started this endeavor knowing that this is the thing that will commit my whole summer to. I was all in. I did not work during the summer, I rejected invites to fun opportunities and saw people enjoying their vacation. I am here trying to study, in summer. It stressed my anxiety heavily. I was lonely, lost and lonely. I later had a revelation that I actually learned a lot thanks to this period of time. I remove anything that was in my way, one of them, surprising enough, was my clinging to the goal. If it took my valuable time away, I had to cut it off. F*ck it, I say, who gives a shit if I fail anyway, I am content with what I am doing in order to achieve the results so f*ck the result, I will be ok. What a paradox, but one that I would want people who are in the same situation that I was in to understand rather than rationalizing.
