A note to myself when the first deadline comes. It sucks, I know, to see that you did not achieve what you wanted in time. To rub salts to the open wound, you felt that you was deceived when you got so close to the goal. God, it feels like everything was in line just so that you could do your best, and you did. However, the world out there still spins and there little that you can do. Take what you learned from that experience and keep going. It sounds cheesy that this point but you know your self that there is more that you can bring to the table. It is the time to look at you insufficiencies. You now know better, so act like it. There is still chance and now you need to buckle down and focus. I sometimes feel jealous of people who I arrogantly deem worse than me who just won't stop trying. Toxic as the feeling might be, it shows that deep down I know that if I keep going, I will get there. There was an idea that I read in the "Art of was" that fascinates me which goes along the line of: "What you fear the most is that you might be successful". I thought about it a lot, it seems unreasonable and can sound egotistic at times. However, the more I think of it, the more I fear that it might be true. That you won't know exactly who you are and what to do with your self. Other fears seem futile against that notion. Let's take failure as point of reference. You might say that you are afraid of failure, but actually it is a somewhat twistingly comfortable idea. You will feel sad as per usual, whine about it with people, get their sympathy and you did not change at all. I believe that is why we often let things slide. Are you ready to bear the heft of your potentials? The more you contemplate, the more foggy it gets, at first. But then again, maybe just ask your soul and listen carefully. I wish you the best of luck.
