Fasten your sit belt because this is gonna be a long road trip. You don't really know where you are going. The out side world might feel frighteningly indifferent at times and that's okay.  Find you reason to keep going. One of my motivations was and still is money and financial freedom. I have seen how much stress my study puts on my family thus relieving it would be a wonderful experience. I am finding myself, who I can truly be if I get my act together. That is what makes this endeavor worthwhile. But that is not enough though, I will be facing the everyday life and clinging to the goal too much will paralyze me. That is the second part of the mindset, which is making moments and days worth while. Seeing how lucky I am to have everything set up so that I can stand in front of this gigantic monster gives insights into how I can appreciate the days. The struggle I am facing is part of the journey (if not THE journey) and it is the poison that I have chosen. Bitter? Check! Anxiety? Check! Self-doubt? Double-Check! That seems like the right ingredients, and is it infinitely better than the alternative of regrets. A lot of the time I am anxious but I take a moment to appreciate that these are exactly what I need and I am going in the right direction.

So find out for yourself, your WHY can be more abstract or detailed in words but make sure that it is clear in your head. Ask nicely, or pray, try your best to listen to the answer, then don't second guess yourself and go for it.
