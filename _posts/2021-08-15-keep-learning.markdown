I expressed how my old CVs now look liked trash. An insignificant part for its improvement was my confident in my field of competence. I cannot expect the unpredictable schedule of companies that I applied for to dictate my calendar. I need something to ground me and keep me on track. I tried doing my old projects again but that get old very quickly. Thankfully I found a learning platform that was every interesting and was in line with what I want to learn. Doing that got myself mentally stable, knowing that even if I got rejected, I am moving forward. As a result, I acquired new skills that I can confidently put my CV.
