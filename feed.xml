It sucks, I know, to see that you did not achieve what you wanted in time. To rub salts to the open wound, you felt that you was deceived when you got so close to the goal. God, it feels like everything was in line just so that you could do your best, and you did. However, the world out there still spins and there little that you can do. Take what... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>The the robin fly, but build a home for it to return</title><link href="/posts/robin/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The the robin fly, but build a home for it to return" /><published>2021-08-18T21:00:00+02:00</published> <updated>2021-08-18T21:00:00+02:00</updated> <id>/posts/robin/</id> <content src="/posts/robin/" /> <author> <name>Tuan Thanh Vu</name> </author> <category term="blog" /> <summary> I started this endeavor knowing that this is the thing that will commit my whole summer to. I was all in. I did not work during the summer, I rejected invites to fun opportunities and saw people enjoying their vacation. I am here trying to study, in summer. It stressed my anxiety heavily. I was lonely, lost and lonely. I later had a revelation that I actually learned a lot thanks to this period... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Keep learning</title><link href="/posts/keep-learning/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Keep learning" /><published>2021-08-15T21:00:00+02:00</published> <updated>2021-08-15T21:00:00+02:00</updated> <id>/posts/keep-learning/</id> <content src="/posts/keep-learning/" /> <author> <name>Tuan Thanh Vu</name> </author> <category term="blog" /> <summary> I expressed how my old CVs now look liked trash. An insignificant part for its improvement was my confident in my field of competence. I cannot expect the unpredictable schedule of companies that I applied for to dictate my calendar. I need something to ground me and keep me on track. I tried doing my old projects again but that get old very quickly. Thankfully I found a learning platform that ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Do get a hold of your Profile and do NOT afraid to ask for help!</title><link href="/posts/asking/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Do get a hold of your Profile and do NOT afraid to ask for help!" /><published>2021-08-10T21:00:00+02:00</published> <updated>2021-08-10T21:00:00+02:00</updated> <id>/posts/asking/</id> <content src="/posts/asking/" /> <author> <name>Tuan Thanh Vu</name> </author> <category term="blog" /> <summary> I cannot stress how much my CV have developed over the months. Considering its current state, you can probably tell how disgusted I feel looking back. I was stumbling around like an idiot. Thanks to that one lady from a random company who asked for the .docx form of my previously Canva-made CV, that I forced myself to convert it into Word. My god, look at the errors! I was trembling, all of the... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Prioritize heavily on work, don't lose sight of health</title><link href="/posts/work-and-health/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Prioritize heavily on work, don't lose sight of health" /><published>2021-07-24T21:00:00+02:00</published> <updated>2021-07-24T21:00:00+02:00</updated> <id>/posts/work-and-health/</id> <content src="/posts/work-and-health/" /> <author> <name>Tuan Thanh Vu</name> </author> <category term="blog" /> <summary> I started my schedule with a lot of fluffs, things that I thought could improve my well beings but soon realized its limits. Taking stock of your sleep and exercise is not joke and should not be tampered with. But no amount of help care can replace real work. Work that exhaust me in the best way, made me feel that the day was complete and worth it. </summary> </entry> </feed>
